In our effort to familiarize ourselves with the Learn IDE, Let's play with strings and numbers again but in the Learn IDE. First things first though, let's open this lab in the Learn IDE. Go ahead and click the blue "Open" button at the top of this page. You should then be _whisked_ away to the IDE. 

Alright! This lab is *very important*. I'm going to teach you how to approach all labs...and really everything in coding. That's a huge statement, but programming is actually fairly simple if you follow this process.

First things first, let's run the code we are given. That should always be your first task. Just like when you are using a map to find a new restaurant, you need to know where you are _now_ before you can know where you need to go. To run the code, type `nodejs index.js` in your terminal. You should get something like this:

Name: 
"babyhxze"
Height:
38
Look familiar? Open up the `index.js` file and take a look. No HTML here, but you can see some basic things. The first two lines of code are below:

```javascript
var name = "Joe"
var height = "74"
```

These two just assign the value `"Joe"` and `"74"` to `name` and `height`, respectively. `name` and `height` are variables. `"Joe"` and `"74"` are Strings. We know they are Strings because they are wrapped in quotes. The next four lines do all of the outputting to your terminal.

```javascript
console.log("Name:")
console.log(name)

console.log("Height:")
console.log(height)
```

The first two at first print the String `"Name:"`, then it prints the _value inside `name`_. Earlier in our program, we assigned `name` a value of `"Joe"`. So, it prints out `Joe`. Nice! What if we put `name` in quotes?. Give it a try, then run your program again by typing `nodejs index.js`. You should see it print out the literal `name` instead of `Joe`. You just converted `name` from a variable into a String. Remove the quotes and everything will work again.

Ok, go ahead and change the `name` variable to your name. To do this, modify the first line to something like this `var name = "Janet"`. Re-run your code and you'll see everything gets updated. Awesome.

Finally, we are going to modify our height. You could modify the height the same way we modified `name`. Simply change the `"74"` to whatever your height is. Remember last time though? We wanted to just have you "grow" but adding `1` to our current height. We can try that out by modifying the `console.log(height)` line by writing `console.log(height+1)`. If you re-run that code you'll see it just appends `1` to the end of whatever height you had. That's not what we want! We want proper addition
to occur. Just like last time, we need to translate our String (`"74"`) into a number. You can do this in your `console.log` like this: `console.log(parseInt(height) + 1 )`. That converts `"74"` into a number and then adds one. If you re-run the code now you'll see that it works! The other way we can modify this is to change the assignment of the variable in the first place. So let's modify the `var height = "74"` line to look like this

```javascript
var height = 74
```

Boom! We took away the quotes and now it's a number not a string. You can remove the `parseInt` part of your `console.log` to look like this: `console.log(height + 1)` and everything should work properly.

Now it's time to submit your work back to learn. Go ahead and run `learn submit` in the terminal. You should then get a few more green lights and be ready to move on to the next lesson. Congratulations
